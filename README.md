# CopBot

Bot uses Python Selenium to monitor nike.com/launch pages and checkout once add-to-cart button is present;
    Will select pre-defined size & complete process as checkout as guest or member login

Still Need to do:
    Enable use of proxies in bot;
    Figure out how to best enable threading;
    Use ElectronJS for Desktop UI & possibly Flask to host as website for edits or check-ins on the go;
        Will not just use Jquery & Bootstrap due to browser incompatabilites;
        ElectronJS also provides capability to make executables for all platforms (i.e: Windows, Mac & Linux) which should all run the same;
    Figure out what model the DB table will need for accurate status & error information;
