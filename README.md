## bot is only able to checkout as a guest

Nike Bot for www.Nike.com/launch/
Only Issue I could not overcome is the akamai CDN bot detector used by Nike; 

It generates sensor data when using the website with a real browser it checks for items not available in the driver.

It is possible to mimic sensor data and automate the process but reverse engineering the obfuscated javascript for how the sensor data is created is required.

Uses Selenium & Chrome Web Driver to automate shoe checkout process.
